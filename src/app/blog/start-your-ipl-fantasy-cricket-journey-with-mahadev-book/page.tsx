            <p className="text-gray-300 text-sm md:text-base leading-relaxed">
              Fantasy cricket is a skill-based game where you build a virtual team of real IPL players before a match. Your team earns points based on those players&apos; real-world performance — runs scored, wickets taken, catches, and more.

            <p className="text-gray-300 text-sm md:text-base leading-relaxed">
              The key difference from regular cricket betting is that fantasy cricket rewards <strong className="text-gold">knowledge, research, and strategy</strong> — not just predicting the match result. The better your player selection, the more points your team earns.
