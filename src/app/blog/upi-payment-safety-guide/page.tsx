              UPI (Unified Payments Interface) processed over <strong className="text-gold">₹200 trillion</strong> in transactions in a single month in 2026, making it one of the most widely used digital payment systems in the world. But with widespread adoption comes an increase in UPI-related fraud. So — is UPI actually safe?
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-300 text-sm md:text-base leading-relaxed">
              The short answer is <strong className="text-gold">yes — UPI itself is highly secure</strong>. The risks come from human error and social engineering, not the technology itself. This guide explains how UPI security works and what you must do to protect yourself.
