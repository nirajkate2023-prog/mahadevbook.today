            <p className="text-gray-300 text-sm md:text-base leading-relaxed">
              Odds represent two things simultaneously: the probability of an outcome happening, and the payout you receive if that outcome occurs.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-300 text-sm md:text-base leading-relaxed">
              Sportsbooks (also called bookmakers or exchanges) employ analysts called traders who assess every factor — team form, pitch conditions, weather, injuries, head-to-head records — and assign odds accordingly. The market then adjusts based on how much money is being wagered on each side.
            </p>

              <p className="text-gold font-bold text-sm">Key principle:</p>
              <p className="text-gray-300 text-sm mt-1">Lower odds = more likely outcome = smaller payout. Higher odds = less likely outcome = bigger payout.</p>

            <p className="text-gray-300 text-sm md:text-base leading-relaxed">
              Decimal odds are the standard format on most Indian cricket betting platforms. They represent your <strong className="text-gold">total return</strong> (profit + original stake) for every ₹1 wagered.
